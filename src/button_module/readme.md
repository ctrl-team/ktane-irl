# Button Module

Recreation of the Button module from "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". The module features a physical button with an RGB LED strip and follows the same rules as the original game.

## Hardware Requirements

* Arduino-compatible board 
* 1x Push button
* 1x Common anode RGB LED
* 3x 220立 resistors
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard (optional)

## Pin Configuration

```
Button: GPIO15
RGB LED:
- Red: GPIO16
- Green: GPIO17
- Blue: GPIO18
```

## Wiring Diagram

```
Button:
- One pin to GPIO15
- Other pin to GND

RGB LED (Common Anode):
- Common pin to 3.3V/5V
- Red pin through 220立 resistor to GPIO16
- Green pin through 220立 resistor to GPIO17
- Blue pin through 220立 resistor to GPIO18
```

## Features

* Real-time bomb timer countdown
* LED color feedback based on button state
* Strike system for incorrect inputs
* Serial monitor feedback for debugging
* Proper button debouncing
* Follows official KTANE rules for the Button module

## Game Rules

The module implements the following rules from the original game:

1. If the button is blue and says "Abort", hold and release when any timer digit shows 4
2. If there is more than 1 battery and button says "Detonate", press and immediately release
3. If the button is white and there is a lit CAR indicator, hold and release when any timer digit shows 1
4. If there are more than 2 batteries and there is a lit FRK indicator, press and immediately release
5. If the button is yellow, hold and release when any timer digit shows 5
6. If the button is red and says "Hold", press and immediately release
7. For all other cases, hold and release when any timer digit shows 1

## Configuration Variables

You can modify these variables at the top of the code to test different scenarios:

```cpp
bool hasBatteryMoreThan1 = true;   // More than 1 battery
bool hasBatteryMoreThan2 = false;  // More than 2 batteries
bool litCARIndicator = true;       // Lit CAR indicator
bool litFRKIndicator = false;      // Lit FRK indicator
String buttonLabel = "Abort";      // Button text
String buttonColor = "Blue";       // Button color
```

## Installation

1. Connect the hardware according to the pin configuration
2. Open the Arduino IDE
4. Upload the code to your board
5. Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud to see debug information

## Serial Monitor Output

The Serial Monitor provides real-time feedback:
* Current timer value
* Button press and release events
* Module states (solved/strike)
* LED color changes

## Known Limitations FOR NOW

* Timer does not sync with other modules
* Mock values must be changed in code (no external inputs)
* No physical display for timer values
